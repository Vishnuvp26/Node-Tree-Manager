# Recursive Node Tree App

## Overview
The Recursive Node Tree App is an interactive tool that allows you to create and manage a hierarchy of items (called "nodes") in an infinitely nested tree structure. This means each item can have its own child items, and those children can have their own children, and so on — without any limit.

## How It Works
The app starts with an empty tree or existing saved nodes. You can create one or more **root nodes** (top-level items) and keep adding children under any node, creating a branching tree structure.

## User Flow
1. Start with an empty or existing tree.
2. Add a root node by entering its name.
3. Click on the plus button next to any node to add a child.
4. Use the arrow icon to expand or collapse node branches.
5. Delete nodes if they’re no longer needed (children will be removed too).
